TTCHAIN
=========

T wil be constructed to be a statible and safe blockchain network by modularized
design, which can use smart contract and digital property. We can construct the Sandbox to monitor
transferring value and running contract as above in tongtongchain. By Sandbox, we can make sure
stability of contract and transferring value safely.
Tongtongcoin is a decentralized Blockchain-based cryptocurrency devised to dramatically reduce transaction fees for existing payment systems such as credit cards and cash, bank charges for online remittance services, and to facilitate the processes of payment gateway and remittance.

TTCHAIN is a blockchain based on BTS1.0 which integrates GLUA virtual machine based smart contracts, yet a software platform designed to help coordinate voluntary free market operations amongst a set of social actors.

TTCHAIN is making efforts to build up a high performance discentralized enterprise blockchain platform, to develop business blockchain applications, to eliminate cognitive fear of the enterprises facing blockchain technology or corresponding applications, to make the blockchain visualized and configurable. Replicas of the state machine are kept consistent using the Result Delegated Proof-of-Stake (RDPoS) distributed consensus protocol.




And support Dapp to use for many kinds of business such as small amount payment method,
mileage/point replacement, P2P remittance, individual credit info management, file management
and etc, and also support protocol for interactive value exchange. And we'll make tongtongchain folk
matching with all purposes and extend tongtongchain ecosystem by connection of folked blockchain
networks as above.
Tongtongchain is used for smart contract publishing, value exchange of Dapp and network by a kind
of coin which called tongtongcoin(TTCOIN)
